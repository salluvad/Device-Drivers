The default major number of all the misc drivers is 10. But you can choose your minor numbers between 1 to 255.

cdev struct:
struct miscdevice {
  int minor;
  const char *name;
  struct file_operations *fops;
  struct miscdevice *next, *prev;
};


//register
misc_register

//dereigister
misc_deregister
